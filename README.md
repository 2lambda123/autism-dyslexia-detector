# Detecting Autism and Dyslexia

This project is partly an implementation of detecting autism from facial images of children, and the other part is detecting dyslexia by scoring the answers from a questionnaire. The later part is not related to ML/DL, but both involves setting up a web application using flask in python.

This is a POC for the KPMG Ideation Challenge 2021, on which my peers (pursuing MBA) from XLRI Jamshedpur participated.
